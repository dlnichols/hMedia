Tasks for v0.0.1 (Silly Skeleton)
---------------------------------
* Convert stuff to Coffee because JS syntax is parenthetical and semi colon overload obnoxious
* Top menu from user role (possibly in user model?)
* Fix tabbedCtrl so it isn't using ng-include, and isn't reloading the
  controller each go 'round (slide or fade transition)
* Fix README and TODO partials to read/translate their respective markdown
  files
* Add timeout (5? 15s?) to notifications
* STUFF
* Create validators (instead of defining in the model)
